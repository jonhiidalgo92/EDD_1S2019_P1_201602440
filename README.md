SNAKE RELOADED
===============

A console application in pyton language is being made. Which is based on the typical known game ¨Snake ¨
the application consists in applying the utility of the data structures in each of the modules of the game, in the snake module a double linked list will be used placing in each of its nodes the coordinates of the exact position of each one, In the scoring module a heap will be used. In it the coordinates of the acquired points will be controlled, In the scoring report module it will be carried out by a queue storing the name and score of said user and upon reaching 10 they will leave deleting the first elements having only 10 elements in the structure, In the Users module it will be controlled by a double linked circular list which will perform the user insertion by means of a massive load or either individually and to see the operation of Each structure should graph each module separately.
